# Ticketing System
(deployed at https://dev-ticket-tracker-4717cea55e8b.herokuapp.com/)
## Lo-Fi Architecture

Ticketing System is a monolithic Rails application that handles ticket creation, assignment, commenting, approval flows, team-based visibility, and user management. The diagram below is a simple lo-fi view of how requests flow through the app.

## System architecture

Key points:
- Google/GitHub OAuth login (OmniAuth) for quick access
- Ticket CRUD with status and priority enums
- Manual and round-robin ticket assignment modes
- Public vs internal comments for collaboration
- Minimal but functional roles: requester, agent, admin

- Monolithic Rails 8 MVC with Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- PostgreSQL (production) and ActiveStorage for attachments
- Devise + OmniAuth for authentication
- Pundit for authorization and role management
- Deployed via Kamal + Docker on Heroku

## Data model overview

- Core relationships: User ↔ Ticket ↔ Comment
- Teams & TeamMemberships organize agents and scoping
- `Setting` model stores assignment strategy (manual vs round-robin) and feature toggles
- Enum fields for role, ticket status, and comment visibility ensure consistency
- Proper database indexes are recommended on foreign keys and enum fields for fast lookups and integrity

## Assignment workflow

- Manual assignment: Admins and Agents can assign tickets from the UI dropdown
- Auto round-robin: toggled in `Settings` and enabled for fair rotation among active agents
- Rotation state is persisted (e.g., keep last-assigned index) to ensure balanced distribution and traceability
- For MVP this is implemented synchronously — no background jobs required

## Security & access control

- Devise + OmniAuth handle authentication (with mocked callbacks for CI)
- Pundit policies define per-role permissions (requester/agent/admin)
- CSRF protection enabled by Rails; OAuth logs should be filtered for secrets
- Internal comments are restricted to agents and admins via Pundit
- Strict input validations and DB constraints enforce data integrity

## UI / UX

- Server-rendered responsive layout with clear navigation and role-aware navbar
- Single ticket page combines status, comments, attachments, and assignment controls
- Focus on accessibility and lightweight JS—app remains usable with minimal JS

## User Guide — How to use the Ticketing System (end-user)

This guide walks an end-user through the common flows in the application (login, file a ticket, comment, attach files, assign/accept work, and basic team/approval actions).

1. Signing in

- Open the app in a browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- Click the "Sign in" / "Sign in with Google" (or "Sign in with GitHub") button on the navbar. This uses OmniAuth (Devise + OmniAuth) to authenticate you.
- First-time logins create a new user record using the provider profile. If you need to seed demo users, run `rails db:seed` (project-specific seed behavior may vary).

2. Dashboard & navigation

- After sign-in you land on the dashboard or tickets index. The navbar changes based on your role (requester, agent, admin).
- Use the top-level navigation to access Tickets, Teams, Users (admins), and Settings.

3. Creating a ticket (Requester)

- Click "New Ticket" or the "Create Ticket" button on the dashboard.
- Fill in required fields: title, description, priority, and any metadata your deployment requires (e.g., project or category).
- Submit the form — the ticket will appear in the Tickets list.

4. Viewing and commenting

- Open a ticket to view its full details. The page shows the current status, assignee, priority, and comment thread.
- Add a public comment to collaborate with requesters and agents. If you are an agent or admin you may also be able to add an internal comment (visible only to staff). The comment form has a visibility toggle (Public/Internal) if internal comments are supported.
- Attach files to comments where helpful (screenshots, logs). Attachments are uploaded via ActiveStorage and shown inline or as download links.

5. Assignment and claiming work (Agent / Admin)

- Manual assignment: From the ticket page, use the "Assignee" dropdown to assign the ticket to an agent. Admins and authorized agents will see this control.
- Claiming: Optionally click a "Claim" or "Take" button (if implemented) to assign the ticket to yourself quickly.
- Round-robin: If Settings has auto-assignment enabled, new tickets are assigned automatically according to the rotation state stored in `Setting`.

6. Approval workflow (Admin / Agent)

- Certain tickets may require approval. Use the Approve/Reject controls visible to staff when the ticket's workflow requires it.
- Approval actions record the approver and timestamp so actions are auditable.
- When creating/editing tickets, you can add attachments for evidence/workflows.

7. Teams and memberships (Admin)

- Admins can create `Teams` and add or remove `TeamMemberships` to organize agents.
- Team scoping may limit visible tickets to members of the team; use teams to group related work.

8. Settings and toggles (Admin)

- Open Settings to toggle assignment strategy (manual vs. round-robin) and other feature flags.
- The round-robin rotation index is persisted so reassignment resumes fairly across sessions.

9. Searching and filtering tickets

- Use the Tickets index filters to search by status, assignee, priority, team, or requester.
- Saved filters or bookmarks may be available depending on UI features.

10. Common error cases & troubleshooting

- Login errors: Check OAuth credentials in `.env`, ensure authorized redirect URIs in the provider console, and confirm the callback URL matches the app.
- Attachment errors: Ensure storage is configured (local disk for development) and that file size limits are respected.
- Authorization errors: If you receive "Not Authorized" pages, verify your role and team membership; Pundit policies enforce access.

11. Accessibility & keyboard use

- The UI uses server-rendered HTML and Hotwire—keyboard focus and ARIA attributes are prioritized. Use `Tab` to navigate and `Enter` to submit forms where appropriate.

12. Where to get help

- Check the project README and `docs/adr/` for architecture and decision rationale.
- For developer help, inspect controller code (`app/controllers/`), Pundit policies (`app/policies/`), and models (`app/models/`) to understand behavior.

---

## Testing & deployment

- RSpec + FactoryBot for unit and policy tests
- Cucumber (with Capybara) for end-to-end acceptance tests
- OAuth callbacks are mocked in CI to improve reliability
- Deploy via Kamal + Docker to Heroku; dotenv used for secrets management and SSL is enforced where possible

---

## User request flow (high level)

User -> Browser -> Rails Router -> Controller -> Pundit authorization -> Model -> Database

Responses are rendered as HTML via ERB or as JSON for API-like endpoints; Turbo Streams and Frames are used for partial page updates.

---

## Tests (quick summary)

Run tests locally:

```bash
# Run full RSpec suite
bundle exec rspec

# Run Cucumber features
bundle exec cucumber --format pretty

# Run a focused file
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/tickets_spec.rb
```

---

## Debug pointers (concise)

- OAuth login failures: check `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` and authorized redirect URIs in Google Console.
- Pundit errors: ensure `include Pundit` in `ApplicationController` and the `pundit` gem is present.
- Asset issues in production: inspect `assets:precompile` logs; reproduce locally with `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile`.
- SQLite vs Postgres differences: prefer testing with Postgres locally for production parity.

---

## Notes & next steps

- Diagrams and ADRs are in `docs/` (please confirm or add additional ADRs).
- Consider adding GitHub Actions workflows to run tests and Brakeman on PRs.
